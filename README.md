# Pantry Pal

Pantry Pal is still a work in progress, but eventually it will be an app where you can store info on all the groceries you have in your pantry, cupboards, fridge, anywhere you store food. Pantry Pal will alert you when you have food about to expire, or when you are running low on anything.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node, MongoDB

I'm using the basic MERN stack to develop Pantry Pal. For now images are stored with Cloudinary, the database is hosted on a free MongoDB Atlas cluster, and the app itself is hosted on NameCheap shared web hosting.
